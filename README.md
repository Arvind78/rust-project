Rust Project: Calculator and Alphabet Guessing Game
Project Description
This project is divided into two main components: a calculator and an alphabet guessing game, both implemented in the Rust programming language. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic Rust concepts such as variables, data types, conditional expressions, loops, and user input handling.

1. Calculator
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The process involves the following steps:

User Input: The user enters the first number.
Operator Input: The user specifies the operator (+, -, *, /).
Second Number: The user enters the second number.
Calculation: Based on the operator, the appropriate arithmetic operation is performed.
Output: The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.
Example Workflow
User inputs: 5
Operator: *
User inputs: 3
Output: 15
2. Alphabet Guessing Game
The alphabet guessing game involves the following steps:

Generate Random Character: A character is randomly selected from an array containing 'A' to 'Z'.
User Input: The user inputs a character guess.
Comparison: The user's character is compared to the randomly selected character.
Result: If the characters match, the user wins; otherwise, the user loses.
Example Workflow
Computer selects: G
User inputs: G
Output: "You win!"
Challenges Faced
User Input Handling: Understanding how to take and process user input in Rust.
Random Number Generation: Learning to generate random numbers and use them to access elements in an array.
Solutions
Used online references and tutorials, including YouTube videos, to solve input handling and random number generation issues.
Learning Outcomes
Through the implementation of these two programs, I have enhanced my understanding of Rust, particularly in the following areas:

Variables and Data Types: Learned how to declare and use variables and understand Rust's type system.
Conditional Expressions: Implemented logic to handle different conditions and operations.
Loops: Utilized loops for repetitive tasks, such as handling multiple user inputs.
User Input Handling: Mastered taking and processing user inputs in a Rust program.
Conclusion
This project provided practical experience in Rust programming, reinforcing fundamental concepts and problem-solving skills. The successful implementation of both a calculator and an alphabet guessing game demonstrates the applicability of Rust in handling diverse programming tasks.
